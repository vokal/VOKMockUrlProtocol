A url protocol that parses and returns fake responses with mock data.

## Usage

Create a folder reference called `VOKMockData`, so that the entire `VOKMockData` directory is copied into your test app bundle and place mock data files in there.  The easiest way to determine the proper file name for a mock data item is to make the mock API call and note the missing mock data file reported in the logs.  The full naming convention is described [here](MockDataNaming.md).

***Note:*** **The naming convention for mock data files has changed with version 2.x.**  Mock data files from version 1.x may need to be renamed to work with version 2.x, particularly for requests with a body (e.g., `POST` requests), particularly when the body is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded `.

Mock data files may:

- have the `.json` extension to always return an `HTTP/1.1 200 Success` with `Content-type: text/json` and the content of the `.json` file; or
- have the `.http` extension to parse an HTTP response with the following format:
  - status on the first line
  - headers on the following lines
  - blank line
  - body on the following lines

Example HTTP responses:

HTTP response with headers and response body.

### Using with NSURLSessionConfiguration

In order to get `NSURLSesssion` to use `VOKMockUrlProtocol`, you must insert its class into a `NSURLSessionConfigurations`'s [`protocolClasses`](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLSessionConfiguration_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/NSURLSessionConfiguration/protocolClasses).

Example:
```
    Class mockURLProtocol = [VOKMockUrlProtocol class];
    NSMutableArray *currentProtocolClasses = [self.sessionConfiguration.protocolClasses mutableCopy] ?: [NSMutableArray array];
    [currentProtocolClasses insertObject:mockURLProtocol atIndex:0];
    self.sessionConfiguration.protocolClasses = currentProtocolClasses;
```
In order to switch back and forth between mock and live, you can also take out the Mock Url Protocol by just removing it:
```
    Class mockURLProtocol = [VOKMockUrlProtocol class];
    NSMutableArray *currentProtocolClasses = [self.sessionConfiguration.protocolClasses mutableCopy];
    [currentProtocolClasses removeObject:mockURLProtocol];
    self.sessionConfiguration.protocolClasses = currentProtocolClasses;
  ```

### Using with Frameworks/Swift

When `VOKMockUrlProtocol` is built as a framework (usually for use with Swift), make sure to call the `setTestBundle:` class method and pass in your test bundle. Since the default behavior is to fall back to the bundle for the current class, that would look in the Framework's bundle rather than the test bundle, and nothing would work.

### Using with HTTP Authorization headers

To verify that authorization headers are being sent properly, make sure to set `setShouldEncodeAuthHeader` to YES. This will verify that the value for the http header "Authorization" is set to an expected value. Otherwise, auth headers will not be verified.
